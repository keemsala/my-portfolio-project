            <h3>Hakeem Salami</h3>
            <p class="bio">
                Hello, I'm Hakeem Salami! I'm a father of two, and I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science. My passion for technology and problem-solving drives me to excel in the field, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.
                <br><br>
                Outside of academics, I love spending time with my family and exploring new culinary creations. Food and cooking are some of my greatest hobbies, and there's nothing better than sharing a delicious meal with loved ones. I'm also an avid basketball fan and player — whether it's watching a game or hitting the court myself, basketball is a big part of my life.
                <br><br>
                I’m excited to continue this journey and see where my skills in data science take me, while always keeping a balance between work, family, and personal passions.
